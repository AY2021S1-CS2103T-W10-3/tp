## Project: Taskmania

Taskmania (based off AB3) is a **desktop app for a project leader to manage team members and tasks** to be finished in a
 software project, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a 
 Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Taskmania can allow you to manage your team faster than 
 a traditional point and click interface.
